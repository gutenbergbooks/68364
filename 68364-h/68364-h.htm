<p class="center largefont nobreak">From the Diary of a New York Detective.</p>

<p class="center nobreak">EDITED BY FRANK PEMMON.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Chance Meeting.</h2>
</div>


<p>Several years ago I was detailed to undertake
the solution of a mystery surrounding a robbery
which had baffled the police for a month or
more. Then two detectives had been set at
work upon it and had failed to locate the
thief. I was given the case. I did not exactly
succeed in finding the thief, but I brought him
to justice, just the same. How, you shall see.</p>

<p>The house of Mr. Bond had been broken
into and a large amount of jewelry stolen.
Among the latter was a handsome gold watch
belonging to the daughter of Mr. Bond. It
had been a birthday present from her mother,
and was highly prized by her. Her father
offered a large reward for its recovery. I
called at the home of Mr. Bond to get a description
of the missing jewelry and whatever other
information the family could give me. This
was little enough. The jewelry had been
stolen and no trace of the thief was to be
found. That was all. I was expected, with
no clue whatever to work upon, to ferret out
and bring the thief to justice, and at the same
time recover Miss Bond’s watch. The only<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
thing that the thief had left behind him was a
piece of paper on which was written the
words:</p>

<p>“Remember the poor.” I did not regard
this as being of any importance, and gave it
little or no thought.</p>

<p>I was a young man at the time, unmarried,
and, as it may be guessed, susceptible to the
charms of pretty girls. Miss Bond—Clara—was
a pretty girl, and I may as well confess, I
fell in love with her at first sight. I also made
an impression upon her. This caused me all
the more eagerly to work up the case and try
to bring it to a successful conclusion. Who
knows, thought I, what may be at the end of
it? I made a good many visits to the Bond
house, nominally to seek information, in reality
to gaze upon the face of the charming Miss
Bond. My search for the thief did not progress
very favorably. In fact, I had made no
progress whatever. It promised to remain an
unsolved mystery. I could not find the thief.
Now comes the strange part of the story—how
the thief found me. I had just boarded a
railway train when a man followed me, and
quietly slipped into the seat next to me. He
carried a small bag which he hid under the
seat. I also had a bag somewhat similar to
his own.</p>

<p>“Well, Jimmy,” he remarked, “how did
you succeed?”</p>

<p>“First rate,” I returned, in a whisper, so as
not to betray my identity by my voice. It<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
was clear that I was in conversation with a
thief—he did not look to my well-trained eyes
like an honest man—and I must keep up the
deception.</p>

<p>“Got the swag?” he asked.</p>

<p>I merely tapped my bag for reply. It was
nearly dusk and the car lamps had not been
lighted. My companion had not yet discovered
his mistake. I didn’t feel exactly flattered
at being mistaken, even in the half light,
for a thief.</p>

<p>“How with you?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Aint done much since I tapped ‘Remember
the poor.’”</p>

<p>“Remember the poor!” The words flashed
across my mind. Was I on the track of the
thief at last?</p>

<p>“Got the watch yet?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, don’t dare to try to get rid of it.
Where is Baggy John, now?”</p>

<p>What the deuce was I to say? Just then a
man came down the car aisle. I saw at once
it was the man whom my companion had really
expected to meet. The resemblance between
us was remarkable. My companion looked
from one to the other and then tried to get
away. Not before I had a pair of hand-cuffs
encircling his wrists, however.</p>

<p>That is how I caught the thief, got my promotion,
the reward, and last, but by no means
least, my wife.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">How Was She Killed?</h2>
</div>


<p>“If I ever do it, I’ll do it in that way.”</p>

<p>These were the words I accidentally overheard
one day, many years ago, as I was
walking along the beach at one of our celebrated
summer resorts. The person who
uttered the above mentioned remark, a young
man of about 28 or 30, spoke only half aloud
and was evidently unaware that there was
anyone within hearing distance. It was not
my purpose to play eavesdropper. I was in a
thoughtful mood myself, and with my head
bowed almost upon my breast I had overtaken
the young man and overheard his
words. He had been reading a paper-covered
novel of the sensational kind. As I passed
him I glanced at the title. It was, “How
was she killed?” I passed on my way as if I
had not heard anything, and the young man
turned to his book, in which he was evidently
much interested. I had taken a sufficiently
good look at the man to enable me to recognize
him again. My memory for faces and forms
is very good. On my return to the hotel I
saw a number of copies of “How Was She
Killed?” on sale. Partly out of curiosity I
bought one and read it. I was afterward
glad I did so.</p>

<p>Two years after the incident just narrated
I was detailed to undertake the solution of a
mystery surrounding the death of an unknown
young lady. She had been found dead in the<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
woods. It looked like a case of suicide by
poison, as there were no marks of any kind
upon the body to show that death had been
the result of violence. An examination of the
stomach was held, but there was no trace of
poison in it. It was in a perfectly healthy
condition. There was nothing to show that
death had resulted from natural causes. If it
was a case of suicide, how had the act been
committed; if of murder, how had the murderer
done his work? No one claimed the
body and it lay for several days in the
morgue.</p>

<p>The examination of the doctors and others
had evidently not been of a very thorough
nature. I examined the body myself very
carefully and found what they had apparently
overlooked—a tiny mark near the heart, so
small that at first sight it was not observable.
At my request the heart was opened and
examined. The result was as I had expected.
The organ contained a fine steel needle,
pointed at both ends. This was what had
caused the unfortunate woman’s death. She
had been murdered, and the murderer had done
his work in such a manner as to allay all
suspicion—almost. I immediately thought of
the sensational novel, “How Was She
Killed?” The victim in that story had met
her death at the hands of her lover in exactly
this way. Had this young lady a lover
or any one who wished to get her out of the
way? It was a week before she was identified;<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
and when she was, her lover—a scheming
rascal—was found to be no other than the
man I had encountered two years before and
had overheard make the remark with which
this story opens. It was an easy task to
prove him guilty of the murder of his sweetheart,
and he saved himself from the gallows
only by committing suicide after his trial and
conviction.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">It Was Not Murder.</h2>
</div>


<p>Old Farmer Bunker lived alone. His wife had
died years ago and he had never <a id="Ref_7" href="#BRef_7">remarried</a>. He
had no children. People said he ought not to
live alone, that something was certain to happen
to him; robbers would break into his house and
steal his valuables and perhaps kill him. For
once the people happened, so it seemed, to be
right. One morning Mr. Bunker was found dead
in his bed, and an ugly knife wound over the
heart seemed to tell only too plainly what had
been the cause of his death. An autopsy was
not considered necessary. The services of a detective
rather than those of the medical examiner
were called into requisition. I was the
detective detailed to look into the case. The first
thought was that robbery had been committed.
An examination of the house failed to show any
evidence that such had been the intention of the
murderer. Apparently nothing had been disturbed.
A bureau drawer containing a large sum
of money had not even been opened. Then it
was thought that the old man must have committed
suicide. A search was made for the
implement with which he had committed the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
deed, but it was nowhere to be found. It was
certain that death had been almost instantaneous,
and of course Mr. Bunker could not have had
time to hide the instrument of self-destruction.
It was, therefore, unmistakably a case of
murder.</p>

<p>I began an immediate and most thorough and
systematic search for the murderer. Although
Mr. Bunker had lived alone he was neither a
miser nor a crank, and did not appear to have
had an enemy in the world. The crowds that
flocked to the house came to view the body of
their old friend, and to express a wish that his
murderer be brought to speedy justice. Motives
of mere curiosity did not actuate many of them.
From several of them I gathered a number of
clues, all of which pointed to one conclusion,
namely, that a tramp had been seen coming from
the direction of the Bunker farm early in the
morning of the day on which the body of Mr.
Bunker had been found. I now directed my
efforts to trace and locate the tramp. On the
next day I had him in custody. He had not
gone far. He made some very extraordinary
statements. He said that Mr. Bunker was his
friend, and that he had not killed him. When
searched he had in his possession over $20 in
bills. He was also known to have sent $30 to
somebody in Virginia. This money he claimed
had been given to him by Mr. Bunker. He furthermore
claimed that he was not a tramp but a
machinist in search of work.</p>

<p>“Was an autopsy held upon the body of Mr.
Bunker?” inquired the suspected man.</p>

<p>“No; the cause of death was too plainly apparent.”</p>

<p>“I thought as much. If an autopsy had been
held it would have shown that Mr. Bunker died
a natural death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>I was impressed with the man’s sincerity. He
seemed to be no ordinary tramp, and I was convinced
that he was telling the truth, as he believed
it.</p>

<p>At my request an autopsy was held. The result
of it went to prove that Mr. Bunker’s death
occurred from apoplexy, and he was dead several
hours before the knife wound in the heart had
been inflicted.</p>

<p>“You evidently did not kill Mr. Bunker,” I
said, “but do you know anything about the
knife wound which we supposed caused the
death?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the tramp, “I inflicted it myself.”</p>

<p>“You! Why did you do it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>And he told the following story:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">THE TRAMP’S STORY.</p>

<p>“Joseph Bunker and I have been friends from
boyhood. We always lived near each other and
grew up together. We never quarrelled as most
boys will. The families of both of us were in well-to-do
condition. The war came and reduced us to
poverty. I forgot to tell you that we were natives
of and then living in Virginia. After the war I
learned the trade of a machinist, while Mr. Bunker
wandered North to try his luck. He succeeded
pretty well, I have reason to believe, far better
than I have. The incident I have to relate occurred
just before he left for the North. Joseph’s
father died. There are a number of people in
Virginia who, as perhaps you know, have a peculiar
custom as regards the treatment of their dead.
Before burial, in order to guard against the terrible
possibility of burying their friends alive while
seeming to be dead, they run a dagger through<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
the heart. The Bunker family, as well as mine,
had always adhered to this custom. Joseph Bunker,
however, was an exception to the general
rule. He believed the custom to be as unnecessary
as it was revolting. He chose to accept the
word of the doctors that his father was really
dead, and did not believe there was any possibility
or probability of his being in a trance. He refused
to allow his father’s remains to be mutilated,
as he called it. It was winter time when
his father died. It was an unusually severe winter,
and to dig a grave was out of the question.
So the body was deposited in the receiving vault
to wait for spring. In the spring a grave was dug
and everything made ready for the burial. Just
previous to the interment, Joseph expressed a desire
to look once more upon the face of his dead
parent. The casket was opened, and a most horrifying
sight met the gaze of those who stood
around. The corpse, as it was believed to be, had
evidently come to life, and in the struggle to get
out of the casket, the lid of which had been only
too securely fastened down, Mr. Bunker had torn
his hair out by the handfuls, and had torn to
shreds the interior furnishings of his narrow
prison. Strong man though he was, Joseph Bunker
fainted away and did not recover consciousness
until the body of his father had been buried.
He and I alone remained by the grave side when
the others had gone. We then and there made a
solemn vow that the survivor should perform for
the dead man—what the doctor should call the
dead man—the office which my companion had
neglected to perform in the case of his father.
Shortly afterwards, as I have said, Joseph Bunker
went North. A week ago I wandered into this
neighborhood, partly in search of work and partly
to pay a visit to my old friend. I had his address,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
for we had always been in communication with
each other. In nearly all of his letters of late, he
referred to the fact that his health was failing
and that he wished I could make it convenient to
be present at his death. My visit to his house
found him suffering from the effects of a recent
shock of apoplexy. He told me he didn’t think
he had long to live. He spoke in truth. He died
that very night, a few minutes after midnight.
His last words were: ‘Don’t forget our vow, old
friend.’ I hadn’t forgotten, but I put off doing
the unwelcome work until I was certain my old
friend was dead. I waited five hours, then I fulfilled
my vow. I was afraid to be found with the
dead body. People would not believe my story, I
feared. So I struck off and got away as far from
the place as possible; guilty of no crime, yet fearing
punishment at the hands of those who would
perhaps not believe my story.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A Freight Car Adventure.</h2>
</div>


<p>The freight cars of the B. &amp; R. Railroad were
being systematically robbed. During one month
in 1891, the railroad company lost over $5,000 in
this way. It was impossible to catch the thieves.
On several occasions the conductor, engineer and
brakeman had been shot at, and narrowly escaped
death. The thieves used to board the train either
before it left the freight yard, or during one of its
numerous stops along the road, and hold the train
until they had secured what they wanted, thrown
it off, usually in a lonely spot far from dwellings,
and made their escape. On numerous occasions
a posse of police were secreted on the trains, but
these nights (the robberies occurred always at
night) the thieves failed to put in an appearance,<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
evidently having learned that pains had been
taken to give them a warm reception. I suspected
something more than the railroad officials seemed
to suspect, and when I was told to do my best to
bring the thieves to justice, I laid my plans accordingly.
I sought leave from the conductor to
ride on his train in disguise.</p>

<p>“I can’t allow you to do so without permission
from headquarters,” declared the conductor.</p>

<p>“But I want to try to capture the thieves who
have been robbing this company’s trains and
shooting at you, and I haven’t time to get the
necessary permission,” I protested.</p>

<p>The conductor still refused to let me ride.</p>

<p>“I must and shall ride on your train to-night,”
I said. “To-morrow night I shall be a good many
miles away and I must carry out my orders to-night.”</p>

<p>“I have my orders, too, to carry out,” declared
the conductor.</p>

<p>“I shall ride, nevertheless,” was my parting shot.</p>

<p>I did not ride. I had no intention of doing so.
There was nothing taken from that train that
night.</p>

<p>On the following night I secreted myself in the
train, disguised as a tramp. I lay in hiding in an
empty hay car. At the various stopping places,
I took careful note of what occurred. Nothing
suspicious happened until we got about two miles
beyond C——. Here the train slowed up, although
there was no station anywhere in sight.
From my post of observation I saw everything
that occurred. The conductor and some of the
brakemen broke open the door of a car in which,
as I afterward learned, there was a big consignment
of tobacco and cigars. A large quantity of
this was thrown out. Pretty soon one of the
brakemen left his fellows and started rapidly<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
away from the train. Hastily slipping from my
place of concealment, I hurried after him. I had
not taken half a dozen steps when a pistol shot
whistled past my head. I stopped short, drew my
revolver and prepared to open fire upon those in
my rear. Just as I turned I saw the conductor
take off his hat, and, holding it in his hand, deliberately
fire his revolver at it. On the morrow,
he would doubtless tell a harrowing tale of adventure
with train robbers, and show visible
proof of his own narrow escape from death. I
was immediately taken in charge by the train
crew, and, it being part of my plan, I made no
resistance. We had not gone many miles when
the conductor came to me and magnanimously
offered me my freedom and promised not to turn
me over to the authorities, if I would go quietly
about my business.</p>

<p>“Why do you hold me prisoner?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“For complicity in robbing this train,” replied
the conductor, coolly. “Your accomplice got
away.”</p>

<p>“Yours, you mean,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Who’ll believe that story?”</p>

<p>The conductor did not suspect my identity. He
put me off the train. If he had known whom I
was, my life would probably not have been worth
ten cents.</p>

<p>I hurried to the nearest station, hunted up the
telegraph operator, and when the robbed train
reached the end of its run, there were several
policemen on hand to put the conductor and his
accomplices under arrest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Two Ghosts.</h2>
</div>


<p>The following extraordinary story came under
my observation some years ago:</p>

<p>Tom Johnson and Jack Spencer were close
friends. One evening in Johnson’s room they
played cards and Spencer won every cent Johnson
had. Spencer was visiting his friend at the time,
and retired to sleep with him. Sometime after
midnight Spencer awoke feeling very uncomfortable.
There was a strange silence in the room.
Johnson, usually a loud snorer, was sleeping as
quietly and peacefully as a baby. Was he really
sleeping or was he dead? This question flashed
across Spencer’s mind. He leaned toward his
friend to ascertain whether he was breathing.
He was not. He felt for his heart. It was
not beating. He raised his friend’s head from
the pillow. It dropped back, heavy as lead. The
limbs were stiff. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rigor mortis</i> had already
come upon the body.</p>

<p>“Johnson must have committed suicide,”
thought Spencer aghast. “It’s all on account of
his losing so much money at cards. Now that it
has been impressed upon me, I recall his strange
remark on saying good-night. It was, ‘Well, if
I should die to-night, good-bye, old fellow.’ And
he seemed quite despondent. I also saw him
drink something out of a small phial, poison, no
doubt. What shall I do? I have been indirectly
the cause of his committing suicide. I won all
his money at cards—money which he no doubt
had intended to devote to some special purpose.
How can I face his mother under such circumstances?
I can not and shall not. I’ll get out of
the way for a few days, until I recover from the
shock of this terrible affair.”</p>

<p>Another impulse came to him and he proceeded<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
to set upon it. He took nearly all the money
from his pocket and put it on the table, where
the friends of the dead man would be sure to find
it. He also placed near it a note, inscribed as
follows: “Please use this money to defray the
funeral expenses. Spencer.”</p>

<p>Then he quietly left the house, and he took the
first train from the city. He eagerly scanned the
evening papers next day, for news of the finding
of the dead body of Johnson. There was nothing
to that effect, but instead he read the following
item concerning himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">IS IT SUICIDE?</p>

<p>John Spencer has mysteriously disappeared and
is supposed to have committed suicide. Before
committing the rash act, he left a sum of money
which he directed to be used for defraying the
burial expenses. The ponds in the neighborhood
are being dragged in the hope of finding the
body.</p></div>

<p>His surprise on reading the above can readily
be imagined. He returned home immediately.
Almost the first person he met was his friend,
Johnson.</p>

<p>Spencer staggered and put his hand to his
head. Was he awake? Johnson showed similar
signs of surprise.</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t commit suicide,” said Johnson.</p>

<p>“And you are not dead?” returned Spencer.</p>

<p>“Dead? Certainly not.”</p>

<p>“But I left you for dead in bed last night.”</p>

<p>“Dead! You must have been dreaming.”</p>

<p>“No; you were pulseless and cold and stiff.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Johnson, “that is easily explained.
I was simply in one of my cataleptic fits. No
wonder you thought I was dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I thought you had committed suicide.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[16]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what we all thought about you. What
did you leave the money for?”</p>

<p>“Why, to pay your funeral expenses.”</p>

<p>“Well, since I don’t need it, I shall return it,”
said Johnson. “I was afraid I’d have to use it to
pay yours.”</p>

<p>“I am glad it has all turned out so happily, old
fellow,” said Spencer, and the two ghosts shook
hands.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">He Addressed the Jury.</h2>

<p>A man who had never seen the inside of a courtroom

<p>“Good morning, gentlemen.”</p>
